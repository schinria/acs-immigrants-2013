### W4249 Spring 2016 Applied Data Science
#### Project 1 Analysis of *American Community Survey*

In this project, we will create a data analysis using the 2013 American Community Survey (ACS) hosted on the data science competition website [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/census/2013-american-community-survey#description). Recently Kaggle has enabled *Kaggle Scripts* that allow users to showcase their analysis in a reproducible way. For this particular data set, there are a total of 710 scripts submitted as of January 16, 2016. 

##### Challenge
For this project, I invite you to browse scripts that interest you and find inspiration to write your own Kaggle script on this data set. 

For presentation, the team should present the story and results from their script. 

##### Suggested team workflow
1. Read data description and download data. 
2. Understand how to use survey weights.
3. Team members browse scripts independently. 
4. Members share their favorite scripts and explain the reasons why they like them such as interesting topics or cool codes. 
5. Based on a subset of scripts that members regard as top scripts, members brainstorm about what they would like to do. 
     * "Which script makes you wonder about something not shown in the data?" 
     * "Do you have thoughts on expand certain analysis?"
6. It is ok to have 2-3 leads to explore but it is better to converge on a single topic. 
7. Setup a GitHub project folder with everyone listed as contributor. Everyone clones the project locally and create a local branch. 
8. The team can work with subgroups of 2-3 work together more frequently than the entire team. However, everyone should check in regularly on group discussion online and changes in the GitHub folder.  
9. You don't need to upload your script to Kaggle. It is optional.
